# Next Steps for Attendance System

## Completed So Far

1. **Project Structure**: Set up the basic microservices architecture
2. **Docker Infrastructure**: Configured Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and Redis
3. **Auth Service**: Implemented a complete authentication service with:
   - User registration/login
   - Role-based authentication (Student/Teacher/Admin)
   - JWT authentication
   - Device fingerprinting for anti-cheating

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Course Service**:
   - CRUD operations for courses
   - Lecture management (online/offline)
   - Teacher assignment to courses

2. **Enrollment Service**:
   - Student enrollment in courses
   - CSV import for student rosters
   - Course roster management

3. **Attendance Service**:
   - Attendance tracking for lectures
   - Anti-cheating mechanisms
   - Attendance reports

4. **Location Service**:
   - Geolocation verification for classroom attendance
   - Proximity detection
   - Location-based attendance validation

5. **API Gateway**:
   - Unified API for client applications
   - Request routing
   - Authentication middleware

## Development Workflow

1. For each service:
   - Set up NestJS project structure
   - Define database schema with Prisma
   - Implement core business logic
   - Create API endpoints
   - Add to Docker Compose

2. After individual services are working:
   - Implement inter-service communication with RabbitMQ
   - Set up API Gateway
   - Create end-to-end tests

## Anti-Cheating Implementation Ideas

1. **Device Binding**:
   - Store device fingerprints with user accounts
   - Detect and prevent multi-device logins

2. **Location Verification**:
   - Use browser geolocation API
   - Implement classroom geofencing
   - Verify student is within classroom boundaries

3. **Real-time Presence**:
   - Time-limited attendance windows
   - Periodic verification prompts
   - Teacher-initiated verification challenges
